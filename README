Data source changes, Jun 6
==========================

On Jun 6, today, the OC health authority significantly changed the way
they present the data.  The variables full of raw data were gone from
their website.

The data allowed us to follow their corrections to prior day's data,
confirmed cases.  The deaths did not appear to change and the
cumulative reflected this.

So today, we perform the simple update of the csv file with 479 cases
and 17 deaths.  No checking of the prior days is performed.

Adding today's totals to the previous data matches on deaths, but is
30 cases higher that the 11960 cumulative reported on the website,
11960.

True ups to be performed later as we learn how to access the raw data.

Convert to python 3.8.3 running under pipenv
============================================

Build python 3.8.3 on ubuntu 18.04

cp ~/Downloads/Python-3.8.3.tgz .
tar xzf Python-3.8.3.tgz 
../configure --help
../configure --prefix=/opt/python3.8 --enable-optimizations
touch start_install_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`; sudo make altinstall; touch finish_install_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`
/opt/python3.8/bin/python3.8 -V

Misses many build dependencies; to resolve:
first did this to add lzma
apt install liblzma-dev
but then realized this was no a full list; saw post to do this:
apt-get build-dep python3.6
but the above requires uncommenting
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main restricted
in /etc/apt/sources.list
in addition, to get fm 3.6 to 3.8.3
apt-get install uuid-dev

Install pipenv and upgrade pip based upon python3.8

Update PATH in .bashrc:
export PATH=/opt/python3.8/bin:$PATH
touch start_install_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`; pip3.8 install pipenv --user; touch finish_install_`date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`
pip3.8 install --upgrade pip --user

Put the covid19_analytics package under pipenv

In covid19_analytics $TOP:
pipenv install pandas
pipenv install matplotlib
git add Pipfile	Pipfile.lock
git checkout -b pipfile_work
git commit
convert shebang in covid19_analytics/covid19 to
#!/usr/bin/env python3.8

then to run:
pipenv shell
emacs needs eval
(setq comint-process-echoes t)
exit
