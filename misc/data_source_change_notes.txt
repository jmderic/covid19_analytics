Data source changes, Jun 6
==========================

On Jun 6, today, the OC health authority significantly changed the way
they present the data.  The variables full of raw data were gone from
their website.

The data allowed us to follow their corrections to prior day's data,
confirmed cases.  The deaths did not appear to change and the
cumulative reflected this.

So today, we perform the simple update of the csv file with 479 cases
and 17 deaths.  No checking of the prior days is performed.

Adding today's totals to the previous data matches on deaths, but is
30 cases higher that the 11960 cumulative reported on the website,
11960.

True ups to be performed later as we learn how to access the raw data.
